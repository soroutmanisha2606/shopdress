# ShopDressUp Website Clone

ShopDressUp Clone was a **Unit-7 Construct Week Project** at Masai School. In this project, we tried to replicate the **ShopDressUp e-commerce website**, focusing on building core functionalities and a smooth user interface.  

ShopDressUp is an American fashion retail brand known for its trendy clothing, accessories, and lifestyle products. Our goal was to build a **responsive clone** that demonstrates essential e-commerce features such as user authentication, forms, validation, chatbot integration, and automated emails.
